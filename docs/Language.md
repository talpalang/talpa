# Language Support in Talpa

> This document is incomplete

Talpa was designed with a unique capability to compile for multiple platforms from a single codebase.
To do this, Talpa generates a tree of structures which can be parsed into the target language using the language builder and the target's language compiler.
The language builder takes care of indentation and formatting for all code generated by the target language's compiler.

## Adding language support

To add language support for Talpa, you will need to know a few things.

- Rust (The language Talpa is written in)
- Talpa's structure based token tree
- Talpa's language builder
- The language you wish to parse into

Implementing the language support is a two stage process.

1. Create and implement the structure in compiler/target/*mylanguage*/mod.rs
2. Add your language to the compiler/target/mod.js file
